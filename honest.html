    <h1>Thoughts on school year</h1>
    <p>Computer science has been a very fun class. It's been fun to try to make different types of programs in different ways and seeing them work out. I found it really fun to take javascript knwoledge from last year and apply it to html. I mean, just look: I'm making my own website! Hopefully I can take these skills into the future and use them to have a very successful career with computers. Sometimes it can be a struggle, but at the end of the day it's really fun.</p>
